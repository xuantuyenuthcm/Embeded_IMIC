# Required Libraries for Embedded IMIC Project
# Install these libraries through Arduino IDE Library Manager or PlatformIO

# Core Libraries (usually pre-installed)
Wire                        # I2C communication library
EEPROM                      # EEPROM storage library

# External Libraries (need to be installed)
DHT sensor library          # Version 1.4.4 or higher - by Adafruit
LiquidCrystal_I2C          # Version 1.1.4 or higher - by Marco Schwartz
Adafruit Unified Sensor    # Version 1.1.9 or higher - by Adafruit

# Installation Instructions:
# Arduino IDE:
# 1. Go to Tools > Manage Libraries
# 2. Search for each library name
# 3. Install the recommended version

# PlatformIO:
# 1. Run: pio lib install "adafruit/DHT sensor library@^1.4.4"
# 2. Run: pio lib install "marcoschwartz/LiquidCrystal_I2C@^1.1.4"
# 3. Run: pio lib install "adafruit/Adafruit Unified Sensor@^1.1.9"

# Or simply use the platformio.ini file in this project which will
# automatically install the required libraries.
